Chatbot guidelines:
- Always do test-driven development with the following steps:
    - First check if I'm on main branch
        - If yes, then suggest me to create a branch with a suggested feature branch name
        - If not, then continue
    - Create tests first
    - Print out the high-level of tests
    - Stop to wait for my confirmation if that tests look good
    - Make sure to confirm that the new tests are failing, either by running the terminal command or I have to do it in my shell
    - Remind me to do git commmit
    - Proceed to create code to pass the tests
    - Remind me that all tests must pass with the new code
- Stop me if I try to create code before writing any tests
- All design decisions and current tests are listed in ./docs/docs.md and ./docs/tests.md. ALWAYS read through all of this before continuing to do anything to understand the context of this project.
